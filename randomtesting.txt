I tested card adventurer, council_room and smithy, and all of these three card functions are 100% covered.  
To make a random tester, I generated random players and random seed, and initialize the game with those random variables,  
and then pass variables to the certain card methods. I didn’t randomly generate currently player or dranwtreasure or cardDrawn because even though they are variables, 
they should have been defined instead cardEffect function. 
The coverage is 48.31% of 563 according to gcov.
It doesn’t take long to run the tests because it only loops 20 times each and the card methods are pretty simple. 
Random tests get higher coverage, it executed 47.07% of 563 lines, and have better fault detection capability. 
Random tests can generate different variables and try more possibilities compare to unit tests.
