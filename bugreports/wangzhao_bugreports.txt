Bug ID: 1
There is a bug in function: function_renamed_council_room(state, currentPlayer, handPos) when I run the card test. 
My input is cardEffect(council_room, 0, 0, 0, &g, 1, bonus) and g.whoseTurn = 0; 
after running the function the g.handCount[0] should be 8, g.numBuys should be 2 and g.handCount[1] should be 1. 
According to the result, g.numBuys and g.handCount[1] got the correct values while g.handCount[0] was wrong.
The bug is in line 1295: 
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
The function should draw cards for 4 times while this for loop only runs for 3 times.
This bug may affect the number of cards a player can have and may affect the score; 
however, a player may not play this card at all. So it’s not fatal but important.

The bug is in the function function_renamed_smithy(state, currentPlayer, handPos);. 
My input in the card test was cardEffect(smithy, 0, 0, 0, &g, 1, bonus); and g.whoseTurn = 1; 
and the g.handCount[1] was supposed to be 2 after playing the card according to the Dominion rule, while it didn’t.
The bug is in line 1327:
1327: for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
it should draw 3 cards while the for loop only loops twice.
This bug affects the action numbers and the number of cards a user draws; 
however, there is a chance that the player never plays the smithy card, so it’s not so serious but still important.
