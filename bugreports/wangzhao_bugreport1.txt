Bug ID: 1
There is a bug in function: function_renamed_council_room(state, currentPlayer, handPos) when I run the card test. 
My input is cardEffect(council_room, 0, 0, 0, &g, 1, bonus) and g.whoseTurn = 0; 
after running the function the g.handCount[0] should be 8, g.numBuys should be 2 and g.handCount[1] should be 1. 
According to the result, g.numBuys and g.handCount[1] got the correct values while g.handCount[0] was wrong.
The bug is in line 1295: 
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
The function should draw cards for 4 times while this for loop only runs for 3 times.
This bug may affect the number of cards a player can have and may affect the score; 
however, a player may not play this card at all. So itâ€™s not fatal but important.
