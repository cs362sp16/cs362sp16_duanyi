Bug ID: 1
The bug is in the function int my_Smithy(int handPos, int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state). 
My input in the card test was cardEffect(smithy, 0, 0, 0, &g, 1, bonus); and g.whoseTurn = 1; 
and the g.handCount[1] was supposed to be 2 after playing the card according to the Dominion rule, while it didn’t.
The bug is in line 662:
662: for (i = 1; i < 3; i++) //0,3,++
it should draw 3 cards while the for loop only loops twice.
This bug affects the action numbers and the number of cards a user draws; 
however, there is a chance that the player never plays the smithy card, so it’s not so serious but still important.
